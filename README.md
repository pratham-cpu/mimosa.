Mimosa is an initiative that aims to tackle the challenges and concerns faced by women when it comes to ensuring their safety. It recognizes that women's safety is a crucial issue that needs attention and action. By focusing on various aspects of safety, Mimosa strives to create a safer environment for women.

One of the key objectives of Mimosa is to raise awareness about women's safety issues. This involves shedding light on the different forms of violence and harassment that women may encounter, whether it's in public spaces, workplaces, or even within their own homes. By creating awareness, Mimosa aims to empower women with knowledge and information to recognize potential risks and take necessary precautions.

Another aspect that Mimosa addresses is the provision of clean washrooms. Access to clean and safe washrooms is essential for women's well-being and safety, especially in public places. Mimosa works towards ensuring that adequate and hygienic facilities are available to women, enabling them to navigate public spaces with confidence.
